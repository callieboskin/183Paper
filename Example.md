# LSTM 
LSTMs can be used to generate predictions in text. Below is a simple LSTM using PyTorch to predict sentence endings based off of training data from Dr. Suess' "The Cat in the Hat".
```
import numpy as np
print("Hello World!")
```

The genome is the "text of life", and LSTMs lanauge modeling processing can be easily translated from words to the genome. Next we're going to talk about some examples of how LSTMs can be applied to genomic data.
