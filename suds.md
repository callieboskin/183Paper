## Section 3.1: What are Recurrent Neural Networks?

### Introduction
Now that we have covered some of the basic machine learning algorithms, lets dive into one of the more complex and widely used
tools - a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). We will start with a brief overview of the super-category of Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), then take a closer look at what makes a Long Short Term memory different from a typical RNN. Following that, you
will have an opportunity to develop your own Long Short Term Memory Neural Network by following our code walkthrough. Finally, We'll
wrap up our discussions with a comparison of this method vs. other machine learning methods you might have been exposed to as well
as some potential applications of LSTM's in the real world. 

### What are Recurrent Neural Networks?
say a lil something here

### History and Prior Applications
random history and what it was used for

### What is the structure of a Recurrent Neural Network?
This might seem scary at first, but do not feel intimidated by the complex math or the weird structures you might see. They are all simply a 
collection of inputs, outputs, and arrows that indicate the direction that information is flowing. With that in mind, let us look at a 
simple RNN set-up.

From the picture above, you can see that there is a basic input, a basic output, and calculations that happen in between.

### Uses in Language Processing
It was used a lot in language processing. In the next section, we will show you other applications for it. :)
