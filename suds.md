# Chapter 3: Long Short Term Memory
#### A deep dive into something most people will not even remember long or short term besides for the exam...
____

## Section 3.1: What are Recurrent Neural Networks?

#### Introduction
Now that we have covered some of the basic machine learning algorithms, lets dive into one of the more complex and widely used
tools - a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). We will start with a brief overview of the super-category of Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), then take a closer look at what makes a Long Short Term memory different from a typical RNN. Following that, you
will have an opportunity to develop your own Long Short Term Memory Neural Network by following our code walkthrough. Finally, We'll
wrap up our discussions with a comparison of this method vs. other machine learning methods you might have been exposed to as well
as some potential applications of LSTM's in the real world. 

### What are Recurrent Neural Networks?
say a lil something here

### History and Prior Applications
random history and what it was used for

### What is the structure of a Recurrent Neural Network
this is where a picture or table might be handy.

### A supervised deep learning classification algorithm
Supervised deep learning classification algo. (define each and every term. What is supervised?? What is deep? What is classification?)

type something here

### Comparison Chart

|Type of Machine Learning Algorithm| IDK Some column Here | Efficiency                |
|-----------|:----------------:|----:              |
|Morning    | Oreos!           | Delicious         |
|Afternoon  | Otter Pop        | It's hot out baby |
|Night      | IPA              | I need it. |

# Compare and contrast LSTM vs other ML approaches
## What makes it different (gates, etc.)
## Good for language â†’ intro to how language is like genome
## Good transition to next part

# Text weight

# Really heavy text!
## Less heavy
### Even littler
#### I'm shrinking
##### Oh no
###### plz help
This is some normal text...

This is a new paragraph
that continues in the same line despite the line break.

# Code
You can reference variables like `x` or `y` inline.
But you can also have block quotes like:
```
import numpy as np
random = np.random.randn(10, 10)

print('Hello World!')
```
But you can even format the text for languages:
```python
import numpy as np
random = np.random.randn(10, 10)

print('Hello World!')
```
**Pretty!**
